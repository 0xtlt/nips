bech32-encoded entities
-----------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:jb55` `author:fiatjaf`

To prevent confusion and mixing between private keys, public keys and event ids, which are all 32 byte strings. bech32-2 (not-m) encoding with different prefixes can be used for each of these entities.

For public keys, the prefix is `npub`, so, for example, `3bf0c63fcb93463407af97a5e5ee64fa883d107ef9e558472c4eb9aaaefa459d` translates to `npub180cvv07tjdrrgpa0j7j7tmnyl2yr6yr7l8j4s3evf6u64th6gkwsyjh6w6`.

For private keys, the prefix is `nsec`.

For kind-1 notes, the prefix is `note`.

## Optional extra metadata in bech32-encoded blobs

Parsers must expect to decode extra metadata that may exist after the initial 32 bytes. Any metadata must be added as a `TLV` (type-length-value) item, with `T` and `L` being 2 bytes (`uint16`) each, and `V` being of the size indicated by `L`.

The possible standardized types are indicated here:

- `1`: `master relay`
  - in case the _npub_ writer wants to make sure its stuff will be found by the reader they can append this data so the reader will know where to look for basic metadata and events for that public key.
