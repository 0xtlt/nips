NIP-26
======

Relays List
-----------

`draft` `optional` `author:fiatjaf`

A special event with kind `10001`, meaning "relay list" is defined as having a list of tags, one for each relay the author uses.

The content is not used.

The tags consist of arrays of 3 elements: the first is the relay URL, the second is the "read" condition -- which if set `"true"` means the client is reading events from that relay --, the third is the "write" condition -- which if set to `"true"` means the user is writing events to that relay.

In the future this NIP will be modified with more fine-grained conditions for writing and reading from relays, based on properties of the filter or of the event respectively, written as strings in a simple language.

Example:

```json
{
  "kind": 10001,
  "tags": [
    ["wss://alicerelay.com/", "true", "false"],
    ["wss://bobrelay.com/", "true", "true"],
    ["wss://carolrelay.com/", "false", "true"],
  ],
  "content": "",
  ...other fields
```
