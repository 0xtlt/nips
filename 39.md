Reposts
-------

`draft` `optional` `author:cameri` `author:jb55`

A repost is a `kind 6` note that is used to share other notes.

The `content` SHOULD be the JSON stringified shared note.

Tags
----

The repost event SHOULD include `e` and `p` tags from the note the user is
sharing. This allows users to be notified when their notes are reposted.
Including the `e` tags enables clients to pull all the reposts associated
with individual posts or all the posts in a thread.

The last `e` tag MUST be the `id` of the note that is being reposted.

The last `p` tag MUST be the `pubkey` of the event being reposted.
