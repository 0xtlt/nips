Boosts
------

`draft` `optional` `author:cameri` `author:jb55`

A boost is a `kind 6` note that is used to refer to other notes.

The `content` SHOULD be an empty string.

Tags
----

The boost event SHOULD include `e` and `p` tags referencing the boosted note
and the pubkey of the boosted note, respectively.
This allows users to be notified when their notes are boosted.
Including the `e` tags enables clients to pull all the boosts associated
with individual notes.

The tags should be marked with `boost` as explained in [NIP-10](10.md).
