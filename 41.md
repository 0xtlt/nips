### Poll & Vote Event
-----------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:0xtlt`

An event with kind `1` that wants to contain a poll can do so by adding poll tags and its content as follows:

```json
{
  ...
  "kind": 1,
  "tags": [
    ...
    ["poll", "Choice 1"],
    ["poll", "Choice 2"],
    ["poll", "Choice 3"]
    ...
  ],
}
```

Then the client should display voting options if more than **1 choice** is present in the poll.

The client can then submit the vote by sending an event with kind `8` and its content which will be the index (start at `0`) of the chosen choice.

It should also contain an `e` tag with the id of the poll event only.

```json
{
  ...
  "kind": 8,
  "tags": [
    ...
    ["e", "<event-id>"]
    ...
  ],
  "content": "1"
}
```

#### Warning

Keep in mind that all votes are public and accessible to everyone.
